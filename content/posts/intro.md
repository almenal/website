Hello World!

My name is Alvaro Mendoza and this is my personal website / blog.

I studied bioinformatics in Uni and became fascinated with software and data. 
Since then I've been trying to learn more and more about how to make computers
do things I find incredible.

My main languages are **Python** and **R**, because of the whole "data" thing, but 
lately I've been trying to learn a bit of Julia and Rust.

At work, I help make data scientists' life easier by delivering analytics-ready data
(and I think that's about as much as I'm allowed to say).

In general, I like wrangling and visualizing data a lot using the `tidyverse`. 
I also love Python's flexibility when it comes to building any type of software.
I have made small videogames, built client/server apps, and created a Discord bot
to roll DnD dice.

I believe that using software to analyze data is a bit of a superpower, and I like to
share it with non profit organisations by volunteering with [DataKind.](https://datakind.org.uk/)

Enjoy your read!
